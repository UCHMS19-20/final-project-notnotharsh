# Maze Minecraft

## Description

This game is a 3D game in which players can build and play mazes. It is roughly based on Minecraft, and the only blocks players can use to build mazes are sandstone-colored regular blocks, green-colored victory zones, and red-colored death zones. In every maze, there is a blue-colored start zone whose position cannot be altered. When playing the maze, players must get to the victory zone while avoiding the death zone.
